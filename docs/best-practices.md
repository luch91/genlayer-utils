# Best Practices & Common Patterns

This document grew from [a community issue](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genlayer-docs/issues/345)
and was originally published as a Gist. It has since been incorporated into **genlayer-utils**
as the canonical guide to writing reliable GenLayer contracts.

The guide is lengthy; the sections below mirror the original structure and point to
helper functions in this library whenever possible.

## Non-Deterministic Block Patterns

Every call to `gl.nondet.web` or `gl.nondet.exec_prompt` must happen inside a
function passed to an equivalence principle (`gl.eq_principle.strict_eq`,
`prompt_comparative`, or `prompt_non_comparative`). The most common pattern is:

```python
import json

def fetch_and_analyze(url, claim_text):
    def _inner():
        web_data = gl.nondet.web.render(url, mode="text")
        result = gl.nondet.exec_prompt(
            f"Fact-check this claim: {claim_text}\n\nEvidence: {web_data}\n\n"
            "Respond ONLY with JSON: {\"verdict\": \"<true|false>\"}",
            response_format="json",
        )
        return json.dumps(result, sort_keys=True)  # sort_keys is critical!

    raw = gl.eq_principle.strict_eq(_inner)
    return json.loads(raw)
```

See `nondet.py` for helpers such as `web_llm_strict` that encapsulate this boilerplate.

### Choosing an equivalence principle

| Principle                | Use When                                    |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `strict_eq`              | Output is constrained (yes/no, small JSON)  |
| `prompt_comparative`     | "Close enough" is acceptable               |
| `prompt_non_comparative` | Output is subjective/creative               |

Always prefer `strict_eq` for performance and determinism; fall back only when necessary.

## Prompt Engineering for Consensus

Prompts must narrow the output space to maximize validator agreement:

* Constrain outputs with enums (`<true|false>`) or fixed categories.
* Use `response_format="json"` and ask for valid JSON only.
* Short prompts with few fields reduce disagreement.
* Add explicit instructions such as "Respond ONLY with valid JSON, no extra text".

A few useful templates live in `llm.py` (e.g. `fact_check_prompt`, `classify_prompt`).

## Access Control Patterns

The platform has no built-in ACL, so contracts implement their own guards.

```python
def require_sender(expected):
    if gl.message.sender_address != expected:
        raise Exception("Unauthorized: caller is not the expected address")

@gl.public.write
def admin_action(self) -> None:
    require_sender(self._owner)
    # ...
```

Other patterns include ownership transfer and role-based maps (guards are provided
in `access_control.py`).

## Storage Patterns

Common helpers are provided in `storage.py`:

* `increment_or_init` for counters
* `treemap_paginate` for paging large maps
* `address_map_to_dict` to convert address-keyed maps for JSON views

Example: paginating a `TreeMap` in a view method.

## Debugging Tips

1. Use GenLayer Studio for iteration.
2. Test storage/view logic before adding nondeterministic calls.
3. Mock web/AI results when starting.
4. If transactions fail repeatedly, your prompt is likely too unconstrained.
5. Prefer `mode="text"` for web.render() for consistency.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                | Fix                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Forgetting `sort_keys=True`             | Always `json.dumps(result, sort_keys=True)` before `strict_eq`      |
| Using `dict`/`list` for storage         | Use `TreeMap` / `DynArray` instead                                 |
| Missing `@allow_storage @dataclass`     | Required on every stored custom class                              |
| Calling `gl.nondet` outside equivalent  | Wrap in `gl.eq_principle.*` function                               |

## Event Indexing Pattern

The SDK currently exposes `gl.advanced.emit_raw_event()` but doesn't provide a
first-class query API. A practical workaround is to store emitted events in on‑chain
storage so view methods can return historical event data to frontends.

Pattern:

1. Add a storage field on your contract: `self._events: TreeMap[str, DynArray[dict]]`
2. When emitting an event, also append a record via a helper like
    `append_indexed_event(self._events, "MyEvent", topics, blob)`
3. Provide a view method that calls `query_indexed_events(self._events, "MyEvent", offset, limit)`

See `src/genlayer_utils/storage.py` for `append_indexed_event()` and `query_indexed_events()` helpers.

## Upgrade / Proxy Pattern

When upgradeability is required, implement a minimal proxy that forwards
unknown methods to an implementation contract using `__handle_undefined_method__`.

Example (see `examples/upgrade_proxy.py`):

1. Proxy stores `self._impl: Address` and `self._owner: Address` on deployment.
2. `upgrade(new_impl)` is owner-only and sets `self._impl`.
3. `__handle_undefined_method__` forwards unknown write calls to the implementation by
    resolving `gl.get_contract_at(self._impl)` and calling the method dynamically.

Note: This is an application-level pattern; for safety, ensure storage layout and
method signatures are compatible between implementations.

## New helpers

`web_get_with_retry()` and `web_render_with_retry()` provide simple retry
semantics for web calls when providers are flaky. `timeout_per_attempt` is
advisory — the SDK currently does not expose per-request timeouts at the Python
level, so the parameter documents intent and future-proofing.

`record_event_strict()` is a helper that appends an event record to an
on-chain `DynArray` and uses `gl.eq_principle.strict_eq()` to ensure validators
agree on the event payload. Use it when you want deterministic, validated
event records in storage (see `src/genlayer_utils/nondet.py`).

## Gas-aware price-feed pattern

When gas estimation isn't available, prefer a two-step workflow:

1. Provide a `@gl.public.view` method that computes or simulates the new state
     (no writes). Frontends call this to preview the result and estimate the
     cost.
2. Submit a minimal `@gl.public.write` that performs only the essential state
     mutation (e.g., store a single `u256`). This keeps writes small and gas
     predictable.

See `examples/price_feed_gas_workflow.py` for a concrete demonstration.

## Examples added
